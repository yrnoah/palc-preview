                  Greeting: Australians are fairly informal, so greetings are casual and relaxed. You can expect to be
                  greeted by first name with a friendly handshake, a happy face and a warm smile. Direct eye contact
                  will usually make a good first impression as this demonstrates confidence, respect and openness.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Diversity: Australia is known as a multicultural society, a melting pot that encompasses nations and
                  culture from all over the world. The common values of Australian society aim to include tolerance and
                  understanding towards people regardless of gender, race, class, religion or ethnicity. Australians
                  want to be treated equally and promote fairness.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Religion: A century ago, 96% of Australians identified as Christian and religion was a prominent
                  factor of civic life. However, things have changed significantly since then. Although Christianity
                  remains the dominant belief system in Australia, its civic voice has faded significantly. In this
                  century due to extensive immigration made Australia one of the most religiously diverse societies in
                  the world. Almost all faiths are represented, with significant numbers of Muslims, Buddhists, Jews an
                  Hindus.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Public Nuisance: Smoking is banned in railway platforms, light rail stops, light rail stations, bus
                  stops, taxi ranks and ferry wharves; ‘within 10 meters of children’s play equipment in outdoor public
                  spaces’, ‘within four meters of a pedestrian access point to a public building’; Pitt Street Mall
                  (between Market and King Streets) is permanently smoke-free.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Public Display of Affection: It is very common to see people holding hands, hugging and sometimes
                  kissing in public.

                  Australia’s official language is English. However, Australia is a multicultural nation with a
                  significant migrant population, so it’s common to hear a diverse range of languages in Australia’s
                  cities and town.

                  End of August is the beginning of spring for Sydney. The climate is subtropical with mild, sunny
                  weather all year-round. However, the climate is measured by the sea, so those areas that are closest
                  to the coast will experience a milder climate throughout the year, while the areas further inland will
                  experience the extremes of the weather.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The average temperature for September is 14 degrees and lies between from 9 to 18 degrees throughout
                  the day. The average rainfall is 99mm. The weather is cool in August, Sydney can experience some
                  chilly westerly winds this month. Temperatures do drop on an evening too, so make sure to pack a
                  jacket when you are visiting Sydney in August.
